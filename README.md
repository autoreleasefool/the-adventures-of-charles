# The Adventures of Charles

The Adventures of Charles is a 2D game made with Java for my grade 12 computer science final project. In the game, the player controls Charles in 2 different perspectives, overhead and platformer. The original point of the game was to create quests for the player to fight enemies and collect items. In the end, this was too ambitious for the limited time frame, and so the game became a very simple platformer with some very basic fighting controls.

Overall, I felt the project was a success as I learned a great deal about time and project management, as well as setting more realistic goals for myself. I also began to learn what Java was truly capable, beyond what I was being taught in the classroom.

## The Future

I feel this project will likely not be progressed any further. For the most part, many of the mechanics for different enemies and abilities were completed, there was just not enough time to create various levels and NPCs for the user to interact with. If I were to continue, those would be my next goals to complete.

Due to the time that has passed since this project was last worked on (June 2013), I no longer feel as though I require to maintain any ownership over the application, and so I am releasing the code and graphics under the licenses defined below.
